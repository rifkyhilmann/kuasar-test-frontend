React Frontend Project

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project is a React application designed to provide users with interactive features such as a chatbot, country details, and a login system. The frontend integrates with various services, including an Apollo GraphQL client to fetch country information and interact with AI-powered chat functionality. The application is structured to include various pages and protected routes to ensure secure access to certain features. 

Setup Instructions
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version >= 14.0.0)
npm or Yarn for package management
Steps to Install and Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies: Using npm:
npm install

Or using Yarn:
yarn install
Create a .env file: Make sure to include the following in your .env file:

env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 

Run the development server:
npm run dev

ðŸš€ Available Features : 
Login Page: Provides a secure login interface for users to sign in to access protected routes.
Chatbot: A real-time AI chat feature powered by OpenAI, enabling users to interact with an AI chatbot.
Country Details: Displays detailed information about countries, including the capital, currency, languages spoken, and continent.
Protected Routes: Some pages are only accessible after the user logs in, ensuring secure access to sensitive pages like country details or the chat feature.

Technical Decisions and Architecture
This project follows modern web development practices with a focus on maintainability, performance, and user experience. Here are some key technical decisions and architecture choices:

Libraries and Tools:
React: The core library for building the user interface.
React Router: Used for routing and navigating between different pages in the application.
Redux: A state management library to handle global state for the application. The store is set up with middleware like redux-thunk for asynchronous actions.
Apollo Client: Used to interact with the GraphQL backend for fetching country data and sending messages to the AI chat.
Protected Route: A higher-order component that ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes.
Axios (Optional): For making API requests to the backend.
App Structure:
App Component: The main component that contains routing logic and wraps the app with necessary providers, such as Redux and Apollo.
Pages Component: Contains all the main pages and routes of the app. It is wrapped inside the ProtectedRoute to ensure security.
Auth (Login Component): Handles user authentication and login state.
Features (Chat, CountryDetail): Features like the AI chatbot and country details page are handled as separate components with their own GraphQL data fetching logic.
State Management:
Redux: Handles the state for authentication and other global application states.
Apollo Client: Used to manage local and remote data for GraphQL queries.


Future Improvements
Here are some ideas for future improvements to the application:

User Authentication & Authorization:

Add user registration functionality.
Implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for better security and user session management.
Error Handling:

Enhance the error handling for GraphQL and API responses to display meaningful messages to the user.
Testing:

Set up unit and integration tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure app stability.
Write tests for GraphQL queries and mutations.
Performance Optimizations:

Implement lazy loading for large components like country details and chat.
Use code splitting for better loading performance.
UI/UX Improvements:

Add more interactive UI elements for the chatbot.
Improve mobile responsiveness and overall UI design.
Integrate a better layout for displaying country details (e.g., cards, modals).
GraphQL Enhancements:

Add caching mechanisms using Apollo Client to improve performance.
Add more advanced queries to fetch country-related data, such as images and statistics.
API Integration:

Integrate additional APIs for enriched data in the chatbot and country details (e.g., weather, population, etc.).
